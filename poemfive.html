         <h1 class="on"> O <span class="of"> zymandias Poem</span></h1>
       <p> This is a beautiful ironic poem. The poet has described that  pride or  proud <br /> both had to come to an end. Nothing remains firm in this world. ups <br /> and downs of life are reality. The proud prince, Ozymandias has to <br /> die and his statue represents the fact that everything has to <br /> come to the ground. The statue in the poem represents the <br /> end that every cruel and proud man has to meet. It is <br />better to love humanity rather than being cruel <br /> and contemptuous to others.</p>
       <h2> Ozymandias poem Summary </h2>
      <p>  This is an ironic poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley. In this poem,  the poet <br /> has skillfully conveyed to us the message that we must be prepared <br /> for death. Death is a reality and no one can escape it. And <br /> sometimes, the end of life becomes a lesson for others.
        <br /> <br />
        The poet tells that he met a traveler from an ancient deserted country. The <br /> traveler told the poet about two huge, bodiless legs made of sones that <br /> he had seen standing in the desert. The body of the man was <br />lying near broken and half sunk in the sand.
        <br /><br />
        
        His body had the signs and impression of his cruelty and pride. He must be <br /> a proud king or a lord. The impressions on his face curved the inner <br /> state of the man. One could guess that he would have been <br /> proud and merciless.
        <br /><br />
        At the pedestal of the statue, between his legs, was written that he <br /> was Ozymandias, the king of the kings. He was powerful and did <br /> great  achievements. But all it resulted in despair and frustration.
        <br /><br />
        Nothing, but a broken statue is now lying in the desert. All his pomp <br /> and show has vanished and his name is gone from  the <br />  world. This is how we come and go from the world.
        <br /><br />
        
        The poet leaves us with deep thoughts about what is the value of <br /> our lives. We must serve humanity so that people may <br /> remember us in their prayers.
