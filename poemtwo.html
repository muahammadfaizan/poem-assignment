       <h2> Summary of the Poem The Feed </h2>
        
      <p>  This is a poem with deep meaning. The poet has narrated the story of  a mother <br /> sparrow who has one grain to be fed to ten young baby birds. The poet <br /> says that the mother sparrow is holding a small grain of cereal in <br /> her beak. She has come to the nest to feed her ten <br /> small young ones. 
        <br /> <br />
        The baby birds are very small and they have no feathers. When they <br /> open their beaks for food, the only beaks are visible. The mother <br /> has to feed these ten young ones with that small grain.
        <br /> <br />

The poet <br /> says that humans have learned to break the atom. They <br /> have prepared  for their  own destruction. The poet says <br /> that the real task is  to break the grain. 
        <br /><br /> 
        Splitting the grain means to set life on foot. The poet calls <br /> the so-called scientific progress of no use if a small grain <br /> cannot be  Humanity lies in dividing and sharing, not <br /> in dividing and taking. </p>
