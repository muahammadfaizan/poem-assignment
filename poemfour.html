            <h1 class="on"> T <span class="of">he Time poem</span> </h1>
     <p>   The life is passing according to a pre-defined timetable. Everythings happen at <br /> a specific time. Nature has automated the universe in a way  that  nothing <br /> goes out of control. There is a time to born and also a time <br /> to die. The time for happiness and sorrows is fixed. There <br /> is a time to sow and a time to reap.
        <br /><br />
        The time keeps changing and the things and happenings also change and <br /> reverse. We all are bound to float on a ship of the time.</p>
        <br /> <br /><h2>Time Poem Summary </h2>
        <p>In this poem, the poet has expressed and justified the occurring of  everything <br /> at a specific time. The poet says that everything happens at its time. <br /> Nature  has set up a circle of time as we see that the clock <br /> is round and the time passes in a circular movement.
        <br /> 
        <p>    Timing is everything. If it meant to happen, it will, at <br /> the right time, for the right season.
        </p>
       <p> Similarly, things also happen in a cycle. The winter is followed by <br /> spring. The summer is followed by autumn. This cycle  continues <br /> forever and the system of the universe keeps running. We <br /> see that  there is a time to born and a time to die. <br /> We have time to laugh and a time to cry. A time <br /> to speak and a time to remain silent is also fixed.
       </p>
          <p>  Everything happens to everybody sooner or later if there <br /> is time enough - George Bernard Shaw
          </p>
        <p>There is a time to plant and reap. The time to build and break <br /> down is fixed. There is also a fixed time to <br /> lose something and a time to get it back.</p>
      <p>  The poet, in fact, has tried to make us realize that we cannot change <br /> the course of Nature. We cannot get anything before time - nor <br /> we should worry about losing something if the time of <br /> loss is not yer arrived.</p>
      
        <h2>Reference </h2>
      <p>  These lines have been taken from the poem Times from the book Ecclesiastes. <br /> This poem is assumed to be written by King Solomon in Ancient times.</p>
       <h2> context</h2>       
       <p>The poem has a clear message that everything and every happening in <br /> the world has a fixed time. Nature has set a timetable for all <br /> the events occurring in our daily life. Nothing can be  done <br /> before time. The author wants to make us realize the <br /> presence and autonomy of God. He conveys us a <br /> message that our life and  even this  world <br /> is  fully planned and controlled a <br /> supreme power (Allah).
