        <h2>Summary of the poem Night Mail</h2>
        <p>In this poem, the poet has sketched the path of a coach called Night <br/> Mail. The poet narrates the story of her travel through various places <br /> and the attitude of birds, dogs, sheep etc on her arrival. The poem <br />is simple and rhymic. The arrangement of rhymic words <br /> creates a sensational impact.
        <br /> <br />
        The poet says that Night Mail is coming. He is bringing postal orders, cheques,<br /> and letters for all people. She is steadily moving in plain areas and pulls <br /> up its coaches on steep paths. She reaches on time in spite of all <br /> the hurdles in the way. She passes the cotton fields and moorland. <br />She throws white steam across her shoulders and continues her <br /> journey. She makes noise and passes through vast <br />areas of bentgrass. <br /><br />
        
        
        On her arrival, the birds turn their heads to look at her. They watch <br /> her passing but do not leave their nests in the bushes. The dogs  <br />and sheep keep sleeping with their heads on their  paws as they <br /> know that they cannot change her course. They show <br /> no reaction at all.
        <br /><br />
        She passes through farms where farmers and laborers are sleeping. Although <br /> she makes a loud noise, no one wakes. These people have become <br /> habitual to this noise and they keep sleeping. But a jug <br /> in the bedroom gently shakes.
